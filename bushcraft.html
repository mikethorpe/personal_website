    <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>
    See https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
    for more details

    Try to use only classes, html elements to specify CSS selectors if possible.
    This allows you to override them with ids if you're forced to make changes
    in a rush or for some part of the site that is unique.

      <h3>Bushcraft adventures...</h3>

      <p>
        "Going to the woods and playing with knives and fire" was how I recently
        described bushcraft. Whilst that's not far from the truth there's more
        of an art to it than that. It's the skill of using natural resources
        to live outdoors, something that requires you to engage with and become
        more aware of our natural world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired my Ray Mears, colleagues and friends I love to spend time improving
        my firemaking, carving and survival skills...
