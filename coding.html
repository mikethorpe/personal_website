    We use HTML5 sematic elements for this page:
    <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>
    See https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
    for more details

    Try to use only classes, html elements to specify CSS selectors if possible.
    This allows you to override them with ids if you're forced to make changes
    in a rush or for some part of the site that is unique.

      <h3>Creative coding...</h3>

      <p>
        I started my journey in software back in 2014 working as a test engineer
         for a small medical imaging startup. I had the opportunity to work with
         stakeholders at every level of the Software Development Life Cycle and build
         experience with technologies including C# .NET, Git and Google Cloud Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently broadening my skills with CodeClan to recast myself as a Web Developer.
