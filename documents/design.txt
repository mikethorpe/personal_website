What is this website for (purpose)?

  * Use each page to demonstrate a different style of CSS / HTML...turn it into some
  sort of portfolio

  * Use it to embed the output of code I have created

  * Use it for blog posts

  * Link to LinkedIn Profile and GitHub

Improvements:

  Style:

    * Colours / alignment and content generally (CSS color palette generator and
    picker are very useful)

    * Test styles display correctly with various screen sizes / devices

    * Add glyphicons to blog posts

  Functionality:
    * Add HTML search tags
    * Am I missing any core HTML tags?

  Code quality

    * Implement DRY principle. Options include:
      - Server Side Script for includes
      - Javascript

    * Menu bar - use Javascript for DRY and detection of currently selected page
    for highlight

    * CSS structure could probably be improved in terms of the hierarchy of
    classes and ids...try to have less if you can!


  Hosting:

    * Attempt to host on google cloud platform

  With a framework:

    * Use the CSS and html as a template to dynamically generate your views

  UX
    * Use the same colour text for the heading on the nav bar as for the links
    (user will know that they can interact with the nav bar because of the
    header effect - they will know that they can't with the header because
    of no effect)
