      <h3>Climbing...</h3>

      <p>
        My love of climbing began in 2010 when I started visiting indoor walls.
        I improved quickly progressing to climbing outdoors, an altogether
        more serious activity. I was taken by the physicality of moving over rock,
        the sheer calm, meditative state it induces in me and how it can teach one
        to deal with danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        For three years of my climbing career I worked as a professional climbing coach,
        instructing beginners and experienced climbers alike.
