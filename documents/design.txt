What is this website for (purpose)?

  * Use each page to demonstrate a different style of CSS / HTML...turn it into some
  sort of portfolio

  * Use it to embed the output of code I have created

  * Use it for blog posts

  * Link to LinkedIn Profile and GitHub

Improvements:

  Style:

    * Colours / alignment and content generally (CSS color palette generator and
    picker are very useful)

    * Sometimes text does not wrap correctly in the showcase when browser
    size is very small

    * Test styles display correctly with various screen sizes / devices

  Functionality:
    * Add HTML search tags
    * Am I missing any core HTML tags?

  Code quality

    * Implement DRY principle. Options include:
      - Server Side Script for includes
      - Javascript

    * Menu bar - use Javascript for DRY and detection of currently selected page
    for highlight

    * CSS structure could probably be improved in terms of the hierarchy of
    classes and ids...try to have less if you can!


  Hosting:

    * Attempt to host on google cloud platform

  With a framework:

    * Use the CSS and html as a template to dynamically generate your views
